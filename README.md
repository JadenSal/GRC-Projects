# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Write up - HIPPA

## Objective

The project focused on applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to enhance the healthcare organization’s ability to identify, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. Emphasis was placed on real-world breach scenarios, leveraging tools like SIEM, endpoint protection, and staff training to improve incident response, resilience, and data protection.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of how to apply cybersecurity best practices using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Experience responding to and managing simulated data breaches in a healthcare setting
- Ability to identify risks and help protect sensitive patient data
- Improved communication and coordination during high-pressure security events
- Knowledge of how to recover systems and restore operations after an incident
- Familiarity with compliance requirements like HIPAA and why they matter in cybersecurity
- Strengthened attention to detail, problem-solving, and documentation skills



### Tools Used

- Splunk – for log analysis, threat detection, and incident monitoring
- IBM QRadar – as a SIEM tool to centralize and analyze security data
- SentinelOne – for endpoint protection and threat response
- Proofpoint – to detect and prevent phishing and email-based attacks
- Windows Event Viewer – to review local system and security logs
- Security baselines / hardening guides – to strengthen system configurations
- Internal response plans and runbooks – for structured incident response
- Backup and recovery tools – to restore affected systems securely

## Steps

1. Contain
Stop the breach from spreading
2. Assess
Identify what data/systems are affected
3. Preserve
Secure evidence for investigation
4. Notify
Alert internal teams and stakeholders
5. Disclose
Notify patients or regulators (if required)
6.Remediate
Patch systems, reset credentials, restore services
7. Document
Create a full incident report
8. Improve
Learn from it and harden systems
